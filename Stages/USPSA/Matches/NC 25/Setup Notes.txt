Stage 1 will be the most annoying to set up b/c of the posts and stuff at the back of the bay.
We have to get the angles so that we don't shoot directly into those posts.

Stage 2 we are gonna use a Max Trap instead of Clamshell b/c the clamshell that we have sucks.

Stage 3 we want the activator and Drop Turn to be available from at least 2 spots.

Stage 5 I want some of those steel to be forward falling to screw with people's minds.

Stage 6, I wanted hard-cover steel behind the bobber to mess with people. But if that's gonna cause problems, we will drop it.

Stage 7, Burton is supposed to build a special Low Port wall for that stage. He hasn't done it yet.

Stage 8, I'm gonna ignore the hard-cover steel behind the Sidewinder.

Stage 9, we need to make sure that we build it so that shooter can't stand at the start and take 12+ shots
